<h2>When does ramadan start?</h2>
    <p><strong>Ramadan</strong> starts when the islamic calendar's month becomes Ramadan or on the last day of the month that will start Ramadan</p>

<h2>The Spiritual Significance of Ramadan</h2>
<p><strong>Ramadan</strong> is considered the holiest month in Islam. It is believed that during this month, the Quran was first revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muslims use this time for deep reflection, increased prayer, and strengthening their connection with Allah. The month teaches self-discipline, empathy for those less fortunate, and gratitude for blessings.</p>

<h2>Iftar and Suhoor</h2>
<p><strong>Suhoor:</strong> The pre-dawn meal eaten before Fajr prayer. It provides energy for the day ahead and is considered a blessed meal.</p>
<p><strong>Iftar:</strong> The evening meal that breaks the fast at sunset (Maghrib time). Traditionally, Muslims break their fast with dates and water, following the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), before performing Maghrib prayer and then having a full meal.</p>

<h2>Laylat al-Qadr (Night of Power)</h2>
<p><strong>Laylat al-Qadr</strong> is considered the holiest night of the year, occurring during the last ten days of Ramadan, often on an odd-numbered night (21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, or 29th). It is believed that worship on this night is better than worship for a thousand months. Muslims spend this night in prayer, recitation of the Quran, and supplication.</p>

<h2>Zakat and Charity</h2>
<p><strong>Ramadan</strong> is a time of increased charity and giving. Muslims are encouraged to give Zakat (obligatory charity) and Sadaqah (voluntary charity) during this month. Many Muslims also pay their annual Zakat during Ramadan to maximize their spiritual rewards. Feeding the hungry and helping those in need are highly emphasized acts of worship during this blessed month.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Fasting</h2>
<p>Beyond the spiritual benefits, fasting during Ramadan offers physical and mental advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Promotes self-control and discipline</li>
    <li>Encourages empathy and compassion for the less fortunate</li>
    <li>Can improve physical health through detoxification</li>
    <li>Strengthens community bonds through shared Iftar meals</li>
    <li>Enhances mental clarity and focus</li>
    <li>Teaches gratitude and appreciation for blessings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eid al-Fitr</h2>
<p>Ramadan concludes with the celebration of Eid al-Fitr, a three-day festival that begins on the first day of Shawwal (the month following Ramadan). Muslims gather for special prayers, exchange gifts, share meals with family and friends, and give charity. It is a time of joy, gratitude, and celebration after a month of spiritual growth and devotion.</p>
